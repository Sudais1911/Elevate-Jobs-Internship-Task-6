## 📊 1. Dataset Overview

```python
df.info()
df.describe(include='all')
Total Rows: 891

Total Columns: 12

Target: Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

Embarked: 2

📈 2. Univariate Analysis
a. Age Distribution
python
Copy
Edit
sns.histplot(df['Age'].dropna(), bins=30, kde=True)
📌 Observation: Most passengers were between 20-40 years old.

b. Fare Distribution
python
Copy
Edit
sns.histplot(df['Fare'], bins=30, kde=True)
📌 Observation: Majority of fares were below 100; a few high outliers exist.

🧭 3. Categorical Analysis
a. Sex and Survival
python
Copy
Edit
df['Sex'].value_counts()
sns.countplot(x='Sex', hue='Survived', data=df)
📌 Observation: Females had a higher survival rate than males.

b. Passenger Class
python
Copy
Edit
df['Pclass'].value_counts()
sns.countplot(x='Pclass', hue='Survived', data=df)
📌 Observation: 1st class passengers were more likely to survive.

c. Embarkation Port
python
Copy
Edit
df['Embarked'].value_counts()
sns.countplot(x='Embarked', hue='Survived', data=df)
📌 Observation: Most passengers boarded from Southampton (S).

🔗 4. Bivariate Analysis
a. Boxplot - Age vs Survived
python
Copy
Edit
sns.boxplot(x='Survived', y='Age', data=df)
📌 Observation: Survivors were generally younger.

b. Boxplot - Fare vs Survived
python
Copy
Edit
sns.boxplot(x='Survived', y='Fare', data=df)
📌 Observation: Higher fare-paying passengers had a higher survival chance.

c. Boxplot - Pclass vs Survived
python
Copy
Edit
sns.boxplot(x='Survived', y='Pclass', data=df)
📌 Observation: 1st class had the highest survival rate.

🔍 5. Multivariate Analysis
a. Pairplot
python
Copy
Edit
sns.pairplot(df[['Survived','Pclass','Age','Fare','SibSp','Parch']].dropna(), hue='Survived')
📌 Observation: Fare and Pclass show a visual correlation with survival.

b. Correlation Heatmap
python
Copy
Edit
sns.heatmap(df.corr(), annot=True, cmap="coolwarm")
📌 Observation:

Survived positively correlated with Fare (0.26)

Survived negatively correlated with Pclass (-0.34)

c. Scatterplot - Fare vs Age
python
Copy
Edit
sns.scatterplot(x='Age', y='Fare', hue='Survived', data=df)
📌 Observation: High fare-paying younger individuals had better survival outcomes.

📝 6. Summary of Findings
Women and children had higher survival rates.

1st class passengers were more likely to survive.

Higher fare correlates with better survival odds.

Age and Fare show meaningful trends when compared with Survived.

📌 7. Suggestions
Consider imputing missing values (Age, Embarked) before modeling.

Use Pclass, Sex, Fare, and Age as strong features in predictive models.

Visual patterns suggest socio-economic status influenced survival.
